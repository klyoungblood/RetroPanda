# RetroPanda

Demonstrates use of OpenGL render-to-texture with Panda3D to create retro-style games.

Note that due to the coordinate system used by Panda3d, the Z axis serves as the Y axis of the gameplay plane, while the Y axis changes layers with Y- being foreground and Y+ being background layers.
